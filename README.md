📌 Project Title

Mall Customer Classification using K-Means Clustering

📖 Introduction

Mall Customer Classification is a data analysis technique used to group customers based on similar characteristics and purchasing behavior. By analyzing customer data such as income and spending patterns, businesses can better understand their customers and design targeted marketing strategies.

This project applies the K-Means Clustering algorithm, an unsupervised learning method, to classify mall customers into meaningful groups without using labeled data.

🎯 Objective of the Project

To classify mall customers into different groups

To identify customers with similar purchasing behavior

To apply unsupervised learning for customer analysis

To support data-driven marketing and business decisions

🧠 Algorithm Used – K-Means Clustering

Partitions data into K distinct clusters

Assigns each data point to the nearest cluster centroid

Minimizes Within-Cluster Sum of Squares (WCSS)

Efficient and widely used clustering algorithm

🛠️ Tools & Technologies Used

Programming Language: Python

Platform: Jupyter Notebook

Libraries Used:

pandas

numpy

matplotlib

seaborn

scikit-learn

📂 Dataset Description
